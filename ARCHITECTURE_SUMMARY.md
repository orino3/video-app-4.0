# Video Platform Architecture Summary

## 🎯 Core Architectural Decision

**The annotation system must work identically for both uploaded videos and YouTube videos.**

This fundamental requirement drives our entire architecture.

---

## 📋 Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Video Sources ✅/🚧
1. ✅ **Upload System** - Store videos in Supabase Storage
2. 🚧 **YouTube Integration** - Add YouTube videos by URL
3. 📋 **Future: Vimeo Integration** - Add Vimeo support

### Phase 2: Unified Video Player 🎮
1. **Player Interface** - Abstract video player operations
2. **HTML5 Adapter** - For uploaded videos
3. **YouTube Adapter** - For YouTube videos
4. **Unified Component** - Single player for all sources

### Phase 3: Annotation Layer 📝
1. **Canvas System** - Works over ANY video player
2. **Drawing Tools** - Same tools for all video types
3. **Time Sync** - Accurate annotation timing
4. **Data Storage** - Unified annotation format

### Phase 4: Advanced Features 🚀
1. **Video Loops** - Work on all video types
2. **Compilations** - Mix YouTube and uploaded videos
3. **Sharing** - Unified sharing system
4. **Analytics** - Track all video types

## 🏗️ Key Architecture Components

### 1. Video Player Abstraction
```typescript
interface UnifiedVideoPlayer {
  // Same interface for YouTube, uploaded videos, etc.
  play(): void;
  pause(): void;
  getCurrentTime(): number;
  seek(time: number): void;
  // ... more methods
}
```

### 2. Adapter Pattern
```typescript
// Each video source has an adapter
class YouTubePlayerAdapter implements UnifiedVideoPlayer { }
class HTML5PlayerAdapter implements UnifiedVideoPlayer { }
```

### 3. Canvas Overlay Strategy
```typescript
// Canvas positioned absolutely over video
// Special handling for YouTube iframes
// Unified drawing interface
```

### 4. Unified Data Model
```typescript
// Videos table works for all sources
{
  source: 'upload' | 'youtube' | 'vimeo',
  video_url: string, // Path OR YouTube ID
}

// Annotations are source-agnostic
{
  video_id: uuid, // Works for ANY video
  timestamp: number,
  drawing_data: json,
}
```

## ✅ Success Metrics

1. **User Experience**
   - Cannot tell difference between video sources
   - Same controls for all videos
   - Annotations work identically

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Easy to add new video sources
   - Clear abstraction boundaries
   - Consistent API

3. **Performance**
   - Smooth playback for all sources
   - Fast annotation rendering
   - Minimal overhead from abstraction

---

## 🚨 Critical Considerations

### YouTube Challenges
- **Iframe Restrictions** - Cannot directly access video element
- **API Delays** - YouTube API has inherent latency
- **CORS Issues** - Cross-origin restrictions
- **Control Overlays** - Must hide YouTube controls

### Solutions
- **Sibling Canvas** - Position canvas as sibling to iframe
- **Time Polling** - Regular time updates for accuracy
- **Proxy Events** - Forward YouTube events through adapter
- **Custom Controls** - Full custom control bar

## 📈 Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Extensibility** - Easy to add Vimeo, Dailymotion, etc.
2. **Consistency** - One codebase for all annotations
3. **Maintainability** - Changes in one place affect all videos
4. **User Value** - Coaches can use ANY video source

---

## 🎬 End Result

Coaches can:
- Upload their own videos OR
- Link YouTube videos OR
- (Future) Link Vimeo videos

And then:
- Draw on them the SAME way
- Create loops the SAME way
- Share them the SAME way
- Analyze them the SAME way

**The video source becomes invisible to the user experience.**
